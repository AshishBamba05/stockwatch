## 📌 Overview

**Stocktrackr** is a full-stack platform with a heavy backend (`Node`/`Express` + `WebSockets`) and a light frontend (`HTML`/`CSS` + `JS`), layered with data engine (`Postgres` + `Redis`).

Users can view live simulated stock prices for `AAPL`, `GOOG`, and `MSFT`, execute trades (buy/sell), receive alerts if stock crosses a price threshold they set up, and view their profit/loss margins all in a stored session.

**Built for speed and reliability — sub-200 ms price streaming with Redis caching and polling.**

## 🎯 Core Features

- **Real-time price streaming** via WebSockets (sub-200 ms latency)
- **Live P/L calculations** with auto-updating portfolio values
- **Watchlists** for tracking multiple assets
- **Alert engine** for price thresholds and duplicate trigger prevention
- **PostgreSQL persistence** with structured schema for users, assets, and trades

## 👨‍💻 Software Engineering Design Decisions

### 1. CRUD workflow (16 REST endpoints)

To make the app more flexible, I integrated a CRUD workflow with multiple REST endpoints that manage a **Create, Read, Update,** and **Delete** tasks workflow.

`/symbols`: 1
   -  `GET /symbols`

`/watchlists`: 6
   -  `GET /watchlists`
   -  `POST /watchlists`
   -  `PUT /watchlists/:id`
   -  `DELETE /watchlists/:id`
   -  `POST /watchlists/:id/items`
   -  `DELETE /watchlists/:id/items/:symbol`

`/positions`: 5
   -  `GET /positions`
   -  `POST /positions`
   -  `PUT /positions/:symbol`
   -  `DELETE /positions/:symbol`
   -  `POST /positions/execute`

`/alerts`: 4
   -  `GET /alerts`
   -  `POST /alerts`
   -  `PUT /alerts/:id`
   -  `DELETE /alerts/:id`


### 2. Leveraging Redis Caching + WebSockets connection to stream live price feed

I wanted to make StockWatch simulate real-world stock trading, and I knew a big part of that would come down to making the simulated price updates instantaneous to make it feel "live". Here's the pipeline I built to address this need: 

- Computing Prices in src/prices/provider.ts:
   - It sets starting prices for each stocks, then continuously updates them with a random step.
 
   - NOTE: Prices updates are configured to occur at every 750 ms intervals.

- Fetching Prices To Redis:
   - In src/prices/service.ts, we take those computed prices and fetch them into the Redis cache. In this context, "cache" means: store the latest known price so the backend can access it quickly.
     
   - NOTE: In this project, Redis is used via the `iosredis` Node package.

- Live, automatic display on frontend interface via WebSockets:
   - WebSockets keeps one API connection open, so it can continuously update the price feed display on the interface, as opposed to having to send an HTTP request from frontend interface every time a user wants to get the latest prices.

### 3. Postgres Database

I wanted to integrate session-based data storage into StockWatch, so I leveraged PostgreSQL. A relational database with SQL structure makes most sense here because I need there to be a structured data consisting of user flows (watchlists, trade executions, alert engine) to a `specific session_id`. Every time a user creates a new `session_id` and performs an action, a new row in the SQL database appears with the same available categories.

### 4. Docker Containerization

I integrated Docker to ease the burden of installing dependencies. Instead of having to seperate download both Redis and PsotgreSQL, `docker compose up -d` brings up the data layer quickly so everyone gets the same layers and version setup of all dependencies.


## 📦 Installation


1.) Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AshishBamba05/stocktrackr.git
   cd stocktrackr
   ```

2.) Install `Node` dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3.) Start `Postgres` and `Redis` with `Docker`:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

4.) Setting up `.env`:

#### Security Note:
Do NOT commit your `.env` file. It contains sensitive credentials like your DB URI.

Ensure `.env` is listed in your `.gitignore`.

5.) Initialize the database schema:
   ```bash
   npm run db:init
   ```

6.) Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Then, open the following link:
`http://localhost:<PORT_NUMBER>`
